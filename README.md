## Markowitz Model for Portfolio Optimization

The objective of this project is to formulate and solve the Markowitz model for portfolio optimization using Python. The Markowitz model aims to optimize the allocation of capital among a set of assets to minimize the overall risk (variance) of the portfolio for a given level of expected return. This is achieved by solving a quadratic optimization problem. In this project we'll be using the qpsolvers package to solve this optimization problem and plot the efficient frontier, which shows the trade-off between risk and return for different levels of expected returns.
